# DraculR

Public repository for the DraculR Shiny App. A new lightweight tool for haemolysis detection in human plasma miR-Seq datasets.

This repository contains all code and data required to run DraculR, including an example dataset taken from our previous publication Smith, Melanie D., Shalem Y. Leemaqz, Tanja Jankovic-Karasoulos, Dale McAninch, Dylan McCullough, James Breen, Claire T. Roberts, and Katherine A. Pillman. 2022. “Haemolysis Detection in MicroRNA-Seq from Clinical Plasma Samples.” Genes 13 (7). https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13071288.

If you choose to test DraculR using the example data, please remember to select "10" as the number of your smallest group for filtering, and select the pregnancy associated miRNA "hsa-miR-186-5p", "hsa-miR-425-5p", "hsa-miR-25-3p", "hsa-miR-363-3p", "hsa-miR-183-5p", "hsa-miR-451a", "hsa-miR-182-5p", "hsa-miR-191-5p", "hsa-miR-a94-5p" and "hsa-miR-20b-5p" before calculating the Haemolysis Metric for these data.
