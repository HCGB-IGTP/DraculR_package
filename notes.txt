## Step 1: Import a raw counts table generated by high throughput miRNA sequencing of human plasma libraries. These data will be filtered according to user specified requirements (n = number of samples in the smallest group of interest) and normalised using the Trimmed Mean of M (TMM) method."

## Step 2. Calculate the distribution difference
## The distribution difference between the background and signature miRNA counts is calculated on an individual sample basis allowing the user to upload one to many samples as required. 

## Step 3. Visualise and interpret results",
## An essential feature of DraculR is that it allows users to visualise and assess the values obtained in the results, through sample specific and consolidated graphics including density plots, histograms and tables (Step 3). These features help the user decide on the level of haemolysis that may affect their analysis by providing a new quality metric. Using this metric the user may choose to remove samples from downstream analyses. However, irrespective of whether samples with a Haemolysis Metric above the suggested threshold are removed or retained, the new information may be important to the analysis of their miRNA sequencing data.

## Comma or tab delimited
## Samples in columns, miRNA expression observations in rows
## Column with miRNA names should have the column label “mirna_name”
## miRNA names should be in the miR-base format, e.g. “hsa-miR-123-3p”
## Sample names should be the other column labels
## Sample names should not include white space or special characters

## Legend Help
## The colours used here are consistent across all tabs
## samples from the public data example with a Haemolysis Metric > 1.9 and should be used with caution
## samples from the public data example with a Haemolysis Metric < 1.9 and are considered clear for use
## Haemolysed (dCq) are samples used in an example validation experiment with the qPCR method. These samples had dCq values > 7
## Clear (dCq) are samples used in an example validation experiment with the qPCR method. These samples had dCq values < 7

## The Haemolysis metric described here: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13071288
## and implemented in the DraculR ShinyR web-based application, performs an in silico quality 
## assessment to detect evidence of haemolysis contamination in the original plasma specimen, 
## assigning each small RNA sequencing dataset into one of two categories
## The classification of ‘Clear’ or ‘Caution’ is designed to alert the user to potential quality control issues in the original plasma specimen.

## Note that samples with total miRNA read counts < 1 million are considered to be poorly sequenced and are recommended to be removed for quality control
